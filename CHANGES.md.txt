Major Issues Identified
SQL Injection Vulnerability: The original code used f-strings to directly insert user input into SQL queries. This is a critical security vulnerability that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary database commands, potentially leading to data loss or unauthorized access.

Plaintext Passwords: User passwords were being stored and returned in plain text. This is a severe security flaw. Passwords should always be hashed before being stored in a database.

Poor API Response Formatting: The API returned raw Python data structures (lists of tuples) instead of a standard format like JSON. This makes the API difficult for other applications to use and exposes internal implementation details.

Incorrect HTTP Status Codes: The application did not use proper HTTP status codes to indicate success (200 OK, 201 Created), client-side errors (400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found), or server-side errors (500 Internal Server Error).

Changes Made and Why
Parameterized Queries: All SQL queries have been refactored to use parameterized queries (e.g., WHERE id = ?). This is the primary fix for the SQL injection vulnerability, as it separates the query structure from the user-provided data.

Secure API Responses with jsonify: The GET endpoints now use Flask's jsonify function to return data as a properly formatted JSON response. This makes the API output predictable and easy for clients to parse.

Password Exclusion: The GET endpoints for retrieving user data (e.g., /users, /user/<id>, /search) have been updated to explicitly exclude the password column from the database query. This ensures sensitive information is never exposed.

Proper HTTP Status Codes: I've added appropriate HTTP status codes to all API responses. For example, 201 Created is now used for a successful POST request, and 404 Not Found is used when a user ID does not exist. This improves the API's usability and helps clients handle different outcomes correctly.

Assumptions and Trade-offs
Password Hashing: Due to the time-boxed nature of this challenge, I did not implement a full password hashing solution using a library like bcrypt. The provided solution includes a placeholder function to demonstrate where hashing would be implemented. In a production environment, this would be a high-priority task.

Database Management: The application still uses SQLite and a global connection. For a production application, I would recommend migrating to a more robust database like PostgreSQL and implementing a proper database connection pool to handle concurrent requests more efficiently.

What I Would Do With More Time
Implement a Secure Password Hashing Library: Fully implement a secure hashing library like bcrypt for password storage and verification.

Add Unit and Integration Tests: Write automated tests for all endpoints to ensure they function correctly and that new changes do not introduce regressions.

Move to a More Robust Database: Migrate the database to a more scalable solution like PostgreSQL and use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) like SQLAlchemy to better manage database interactions.

Improve Error Logging: Implement a more comprehensive logging system to better track and diagnose issues in a production environment.
